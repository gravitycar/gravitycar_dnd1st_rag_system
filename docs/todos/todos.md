âœ… - Fix the import structure so everything is consistent. We need to run all features of this little application from one main file?
[] - Implement Semantic Weighting and Keyword extraction:
```
    prioritize salient words, use TF-IDF, RAKE, or KeyBERT:

    RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction):

    from rake_nltk import Rake
    r = Rake()
    r.extract_keywords_from_text("who would win in a fight, an ogre or an umber hulk")
    r.get_ranked_phrases()
    # ['fight', 'ogre', 'umber hulk']


    KeyBERT (uses BERT embeddings to find meaningful keywords):

    from keybert import KeyBERT
    kw_model = KeyBERT()
    kw_model.extract_keywords("who would win in a fight, an ogre or an umber hulk")
    # [('ogre', 0.7), ('umber hulk', 0.68), ('fight', 0.65)]
```
[] include YAML in the markdown that gets copied to metadata in the chunks to help LLM decypher tables. During table conversion to JSON, we can get the LLM doing the converting to provide the instructions for understanding the table.
